# Pathfinder

This porject is a Java application made for practicing pathfinding algorithms.
Currently implemented features:
  - Pathfinding algorithms:
    - A star
    - Dijkstra
    - Best Frst Search
    - Breadth First Search
    - Depth First Search (not very useful)
    - Worst First Search (inverse of Best First Search)
  - Maze generation algorithms:
    - Randomized DFS
    - Randomized Prim's
