# Pathfinder

This porject is a Java application made for practicing pathfinding algorithms.

To run, execute the jar file located in this path: Pathfinder\classes\artifacts\Pathfinder_main_jar

Currently implemented features:
  - Pathfinding algorithms:
    - A star
    - Dijkstra
    - Best Frst Search
    - Breadth First Search
    - Depth First Search (not very useful)
    - Worst First Search (inverse of Best First Search)
  - Maze generation algorithms:
    - Randomized DFS
    - Randomized Prim's
